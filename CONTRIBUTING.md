# Contributing

## Setup

1) Clone the repository in ~/.nylas/dev/packages

2) Start N1 with debug flags or in developer mode (In the top bar "Developer" -> "Run with Debug Flags")

> Note: Whenever you make a change, run eslint to ensure all variables are defined. If you have an undefined variable, you have to restart N1 by using Ctrl + Q to fully exit N1. Closing the window does not suffice as N1 continues to run in the background.

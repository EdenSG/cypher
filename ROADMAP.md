# Roadmap

This roadmap is not in priority order

- Selection of decryption engine
- GPG verification and check signing status of message
- Indication to user that message is signed by the sender
- Figure out GPGTools message signing (sign-then-encrypt, but what did they sign?)
- Windows support
- Verification of child worker and test it before trusting it
- Audit
- Clearsigning

There is more, but I cannot think of it off the top of my head. Please submit an
issue if there is a feature or bug that needs to be implemented or fixed, repectively.
